        When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me running around Penn's campus, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, hitting the gym, 
        or uncovering hidden gems around Philly. I love challenging myselfâ€”whether it's pushing my limits in weightlifting or diving into the latest tech trends to sharpen my skills.
